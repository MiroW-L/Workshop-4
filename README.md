# Workshop-4



## Starting off (25/1/25)
- Started by coding an adjusting canvas as Leo showed us in the workshop video.
- Next I made a text import before thinking about what my page would be about. I thought about making a Bob Dylan page which would be funny but I am worried about the copyright laws of that so I will just use my own images.
- I tried to add a slider next however it didn't work with my adjustable backgroud which was frustrating. I"ll add buttons and boxes you can tick instead.
- Okay I have dedicated to use a button, some checkboxes, and a text input bar on my page now I'm workign on making the checkboxes change the colour, the button adding a random image to the page, and the text imput putting whatever is typed onto the background. I've been using the help of my friend Ghen again, asking him questions about how I would add/change some of my code. Here is some of his advice:

## Finishing it (27/1/25)
- Also to utilise text I watched the workshop video specifying on it so I could make an enter button that could make the words the viewer typed into the imput onto the page, plus i downloaded a few really fun fonts so it's fun to be able to use that. I'm considering adding one more button and possibly a title page because I got inspired by Alice's (user: glovving) work for workshop 4, I kind of wanted to fork it to turn into something but I also feel like I should just get this over and done with and focus on the upcoming workshops.
-  I messaged Ghen again because I still haven't figured out how to change the background colour, I'm going to watch the class video again to see if I can work something out.

- I also asked how to make an array so it would be easier to make the values change with the checkboxes. And I managed to get the colours to work with Ghens help. I asked about if I could change the colour of the background back to grey but I realised I didn't have enough time to complete that but regardless I have three interactive things on a web browser and I am feeling proud of beign able to make that.
